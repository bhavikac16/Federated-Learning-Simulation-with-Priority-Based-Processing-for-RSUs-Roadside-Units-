# Federated-Learning-Simulation-with-Priority-Based-Processing-for-RSUs-Roadside-Units

This project demonstrates a hybrid approach leveraging Apache Spark and PyTorch for federated learning. It applies clustering and local model training across multiple datasets distributed among Road-Side Units (RSUs). The goal is to prioritize data processing based on cluster importance while performing federated learning to update a global model.
